        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Gather all ingredients.</span></li>
                <li><span>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in shell pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 1 minute less than package instructions, about 8 minutes. Drain and reserve 1 1/2 cups pasta cooking water.</span></li>
                <li><span>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in an extra-large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, salt, and black pepper. Cook until fragrant, stirring regularly, about 1 minute.</span></li>
                <li><span>Add 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water and 1 3/4 cup corn. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, covered, until corn is heated through and very tender, 2 minutes for canned corn, 3 minutes for frozen corn, and 6 minutes for fresh corn. Cool for 15 minutes.</span></li>
                <li><span>Add cooled corn mixture to a blender and blend until very smooth, about 2 minutes. Add additional pasta water as needed to blend.</span></li>
                <li><span>Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter in the extra-large skillet. Add the remaining 1/4 cup corn and cook over medium heat until tender and corn is heated through, about 1 minute.</span></li>
                <li><span>Add corn puree and cook, uncovered, over medium heat until heated through, about 2 minutes.</span></li>
                <li><span>Add cooked pasta and 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water. Stir in Parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper, if using. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly, adding more pasta water as needed to reach desired consistency.</span></li>
                <li><span>Stir in basil and lemon juice.</span></li>
                <li><span>Serve with more basil and Parmesan cheese.</span></li>
